# Computational-tracing-of-light-rays-inside-cavities
The goal was to simulate path of a light ray entering at a certain angle into a cavity through a small opening(with 100 percent reflective surfaces inside) until its exit from the same opening and to calculate the time it takes to exit the  cavity.The cavities were of cubical and eliptical shapes
